# Task 005: Critical Thinking and Risk Investigation — v001

Critical thinking review of the v001 logical design produced by Task 004. All 7 risks and unknowns were triaged, 2 were investigated via DeepWiki queries, and all findings confirmed the original design is sound. No structural changes were required.

## Risks Investigated

- **Total risks/unknowns from Task 004:** 7 (5 risks + 2 unknowns)
- **Investigated now:** 2 (R-005 uv_build version, U-001 exact version at implementation)
- **Accepted with mitigation:** 3 (R-001 CI first-run, R-002 lock conflicts, R-003 mypy strict)
- **Resolved in design:** 1 (R-004 BL-001/BL-006 overlap)
- **Not applicable:** 1 (U-002 Windows vs Linux caching)

## Resolutions

- **R-005 / U-001 (uv_build version):** DeepWiki confirms `>=0.9.21,<0.10.0` is the current recommended range, auto-generated by `uv init --package`. No change needed.
- **R-001 (CI first-run):** DeepWiki confirms `setup-uv@v7` (latest v7.1.6) with `enable-cache: true` is current. Workflow config matches official docs exactly.
- **R-003 (mypy strict):** Analysis of 14 strict flags against planned `hello()` signature shows zero applicability. Downgraded to Negligible.

## Design Changes

**None.** The Task 004 logical design is confirmed correct. All research sources remain current. Theme groupings, feature ordering, and execution dependencies are unchanged.

## Remaining TBDs

- **R-001 (CI first-run):** Cannot fully verify until the workflow actually runs. The 3-iteration fix limit in AGENTS.md provides sufficient safety net.
- **R-005 (uv_build version):** If the version range becomes stale by implementation time, `uv sync` will produce a clear error. Resolution is straightforward (update the range).

## Confidence Assessment

**High confidence.** The v001 design is a greenfield project with well-understood technologies. All external dependencies (uv, ruff, mypy, pytest, GitHub Actions) were validated against current documentation. No risk requires design modification. The design is ready for version design and execution.
