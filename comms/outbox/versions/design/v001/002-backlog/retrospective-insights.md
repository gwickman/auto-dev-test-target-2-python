# Retrospective Insights — v001

## Status

This is **v001**, the first version of auto-dev-test-target-2-python. No prior version exists, so no retrospective is available to review.

## Implications for v001

Since there is no prior retrospective:

- **No known pitfalls** to avoid from previous iterations
- **No established patterns** to follow or deviate from
- **Clean slate** for establishing project conventions

## Recommendations

As this is a greenfield foundation version:

1. **Document decisions** made during v001 for future retrospectives
2. **Establish conventions early** — the patterns set in v001 will carry forward
3. **Keep scope tight** — all 6 items are foundational tooling, which is appropriate for a first version
4. **Validate end-to-end** — ensure all quality gates work together before completing the version
