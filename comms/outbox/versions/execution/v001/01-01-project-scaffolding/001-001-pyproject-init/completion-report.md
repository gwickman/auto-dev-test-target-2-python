# Completion Report: 001-001-pyproject-init

## Summary

Initialized pyproject.toml with uv build backend, project metadata, and dev dependencies. Created minimal src-layout package structure required by `uv_build` backend.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criterion | Status |
|----|-----------|--------|
| FR-001 | Project metadata (name, version, description, requires-python) | PASS |
| FR-002 | Build system with uv_build backend | PASS |
| FR-003 | Dev dependencies (pytest, ruff, mypy) | PASS |
| FR-004 | uv.lock generated by uv sync | PASS |

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| ruff check | All checks passed |
| ruff format | 2 files already formatted |
| mypy | Success: no issues found in 1 source file |
| pytest | No tests collected (expected - no test files for this feature) |

## Files Created

- `pyproject.toml` - Project manifest with metadata, build system, dev dependencies
- `src/test_target_2/__init__.py` - Empty init file for src-layout (required by uv_build)
- `tests/__init__.py` - Empty init file for tests directory
- `uv.lock` - Auto-generated lock file

## Notes

- The `uv_build` backend requires a src-layout package structure to exist for `uv sync` to succeed, so `src/test_target_2/__init__.py` was created as a minimal placeholder.
- The `tests/` directory was created to support ruff checking both `src/` and `tests/` directories.
