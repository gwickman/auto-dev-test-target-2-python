# Impact Analysis — v001 Foundation

## Dependencies: What Changes?

### New Files (all additive)

| File | Backlog | Theme |
|------|---------|-------|
| `pyproject.toml` | BL-001 | 1 |
| `src/test_target_2/__init__.py` | BL-001 | 1 |
| `src/test_target_2/hello.py` | BL-001, BL-006 | 1 |
| `tests/conftest.py` | BL-002 | 2 |
| `tests/test_hello.py` | BL-002 | 2 |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | BL-005 | 2 |
| `uv.lock` | BL-001 (auto-generated) | 1 |

### Modified Files

None. v001 is purely additive — no existing files require modification.

### Generated Files

- `uv.lock` — auto-generated by `uv sync`, should be committed

## Breaking Changes

**None.** This is a greenfield project with no existing code, APIs, or workflows. All changes are additive.

## Existing Workflow Compatibility

AGENTS.md already defines the quality gate commands (`uv run ruff check src/`, etc.). After v001:
- These commands will work (currently they would fail — no pyproject.toml exists)
- The PR workflow (`gh pr create`, `gh pr checks`) will have CI checks to validate against
- No changes to AGENTS.md are needed

## Test Impact

### Tests to Create

| Test File | What It Tests | Backlog |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `tests/test_hello.py` | `hello()` function returns expected string, has correct type annotations | BL-002 |

### Test Strategy

- Single test file for v001's minimal code
- Test that `hello()` returns a string
- Test that the function is importable from the package (`from test_target_2.hello import hello`)
- conftest.py can be empty initially (no shared fixtures needed)

## Documentation Impact

### No Documentation Updates Required

- AGENTS.md already documents the quality gate commands
- README.md already has basic project info
- CLAUDE.md points to AGENTS.md

### Future Documentation (post-v001)

- C4 architecture docs can be generated after v001 establishes source code
- API documentation not needed until v002 adds utility functions

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| uv.lock conflicts on parallel branches | Low | Low | Only one version branch active |
| GitHub Actions failure on first run | Medium | Low | Manual CI fix within 3-iteration limit per AGENTS.md |
| mypy strict false positives | Low | Low | All code is new and can be typed correctly from the start |

## Theme Execution Order

Theme 1 (Project Scaffolding) must complete before Theme 2 (Quality & CI) because:
- ruff/mypy/pytest need source files to run against
- CI workflow needs all tools configured to validate
- BL-002, BL-003, BL-004, BL-005 all depend on BL-001

## BL-001 / BL-006 Overlap

BL-001 specifies "hello.py module with a hello() function" and BL-006 specifies "hello() utility function in hello.py". These are the same deliverable. Recommendation: implement both together in Theme 1, marking BL-006 complete alongside BL-001.
