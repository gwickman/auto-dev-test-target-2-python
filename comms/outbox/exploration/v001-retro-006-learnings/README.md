## Filtered Out

**Total filtered:** 8 items across the following categories:

- **Duplicates (4):** "Handoff documents provide context continuity" appeared in both theme retrospectives and the version retrospective; "Zero rework iterations" appeared in multiple completion reports and both retrospectives; "Quality gates green from feature 001" appeared in theme 01 retrospective and version retrospective; "Sequential ordering works well" appeared in both theme retrospectives.
- **Too implementation-specific (2):** Specific uv_build backend version constraint; specific ruff rule set selections (E, F, I, UP, B, SIM).
- **Too version-specific (2):** "v001 completed same day" timing observation; "C4 documentation deferred" specific to v001 scope.
