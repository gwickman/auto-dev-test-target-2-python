# Investigation Log — v001 Critical Thinking

## Investigation 1: uv_build Version Range (R-005, U-001)

**Question:** Is the `uv_build>=0.9.21,<0.10.0` version range from Task 003 research still valid?

**Method:** DeepWiki query on `astral-sh/uv` — asked about current recommended build backend, correct pyproject.toml specification, and recommended version range.

**Result:** Confirmed. DeepWiki states:
- `uv_build` is the recommended build backend for src layout projects
- The `requires` field should include both lower and upper bounds: `uv_build>=0.9.21,<0.10.0`
- This range is auto-generated by `uv init --package` based on installed uv version
- Upper bound is intentional to prevent breaking changes

**Impact on design:** None. Task 004's design uses this exact range. No change needed.

## Investigation 2: setup-uv GitHub Action Version (R-001)

**Question:** Is `astral-sh/setup-uv@v7` still the current recommended version? What caching options are recommended?

**Method:** DeepWiki query on `astral-sh/uv` — asked about latest action version and caching configuration.

**Result:** Confirmed. DeepWiki states:
- Latest specific version is `v7.1.6` (pinned via commit hash in uv's own workflows)
- `v7` major tag is the recommended way to reference the action
- `enable-cache: true` is the simplest and recommended caching option
- Alternative manual caching with `actions/cache` exists but is unnecessary for v001

**Impact on design:** None. Task 004's design uses `setup-uv@v7` with `enable-cache: true`, matching current recommendations.

## Investigation 3: Greenfield Project Verification

**Question:** Does any source code, pyproject.toml, or configuration already exist in the project?

**Method:** Listed project root directory contents.

**Result:** Project root contains only: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `comms/`, `docs/`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`. No `pyproject.toml`, no `src/`, no `.github/`, no `tests/`. Confirmed greenfield.

**Impact on design:** Confirms Theme 01 must create everything from scratch. No migration or compatibility concerns. Validates that R-003 (mypy false positives) and R-004 (overlap) are non-issues since there's no existing code to conflict with.

## Investigation 4: mypy Strict Applicability (R-003)

**Question:** Will mypy strict mode produce false positives on the planned `hello()` function?

**Method:** Analyzed the 14 strict flags (from Task 003 evidence log) against the planned function signature `def hello(name: str = "World") -> str`.

**Result:** None of the 14 strict flags can trigger on this function:
- `disallow_any_generics` — no generics used
- `disallow_untyped_defs` — function is fully typed
- `disallow_untyped_calls` — no external calls without types
- `disallow_incomplete_defs` — all parameters typed
- `warn_return_any` — return type is `str`, not `Any`
- All other flags similarly inapplicable to primitive-typed function

**Impact on design:** Downgraded R-003 severity from Low to Negligible. No design change needed.

## Investigation 5: Backlog Coverage Verification

**Question:** Are all 6 backlog items (BL-001 through BL-006) still covered in the logical design?

**Method:** Cross-referenced backlog-details.md (Task 002) with logical-design.md (Task 004) coverage matrix.

**Result:** All 6 items mapped:
| Backlog | Theme | Feature(s) | Verified |
|---------|-------|------------|----------|
| BL-001 | 01 | 001-pyproject-init, 002-package-structure | Yes |
| BL-002 | 02 | 003-pytest-setup | Yes |
| BL-003 | 02 | 001-ruff-config | Yes |
| BL-004 | 02 | 002-mypy-config | Yes |
| BL-005 | 02 | 004-github-actions | Yes |
| BL-006 | 01 | 003-hello-module | Yes |

**Impact on design:** None. Complete coverage confirmed.

## Dead Ends

None. All investigations yielded confirmatory results. No risks required design changes.
