# Task 002: Backlog Analysis and Retrospective Review

Version v001 includes 6 mandatory backlog items (BL-001 through BL-006), all at P1 priority with the "foundation" tag. This is the first version of the project — no previous retrospective exists. The scope covers complete Python project scaffolding: project structure, testing, linting, type checking, CI, and a minimal utility function for quality gate validation.

## Backlog Overview

- **Total items:** 6
- **Priority distribution:** All P1 (critical foundation work)
- **Size distribution:** All medium (M)
- **Status:** All open
- **Tags:** All tagged `v001`, `foundation`
- **Mandatory scope:** ALL 6 items are mandatory per PLAN.md — no deferrals

## Previous Version

N/A — v001 is the first version. No prior retrospective is available.

## Key Learnings

No documented learnings exist in the project learning repository yet. This is expected for a greenfield project at v001.

## Tech Debt

No existing tech debt — this is the initial version. However, BL-001 and BL-006 have overlapping scope (both mention `hello.py` in `src/test_target_2/`). The design phase should ensure these are sequenced or combined to avoid duplication.

## Missing Items

None — all 6 backlog items (BL-001 through BL-006) were found and retrieved successfully.
