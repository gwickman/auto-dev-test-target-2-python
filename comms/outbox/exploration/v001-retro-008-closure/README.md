# v001 Closure — Task 008

5 closure items completed, 1 document updated (PLAN.md).

## Plan.md
**Updated.** Marked v001 as completed in the version mapping table. Added v001 summary to the "Completed Versions" section. Added change log entry.

## CHANGELOG
**Verified complete.** `docs/CHANGELOG.md` contains a `[v001] - 2026-02-06` section with categorized "Added" entries covering all deliverables: project scaffolding, hello module, ruff config, mypy strict, pytest setup, and GitHub Actions CI. Entries match the actual changes from both themes.

## README
**No changes needed.** The project `README.md` is a minimal alpha placeholder (`auto-dev-test-target-2-python [Alpha] simple test target repo`). v001 was infrastructure-only (scaffolding + quality gates), which does not warrant README updates. The description remains accurate.

## Repository
**Clean.**
- Open PRs: 0
- Stale branches: 0
- Working tree: Pre-existing untracked exploration files only (not v001 artifacts)

## Documentation Review

| Document | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `docs/auto-dev/PLAN.md` | **Updated** — v001 marked completed |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | Verified current |
| `README.md` | Verified current — no changes needed |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Does not exist |
| `docs/DEVELOPER.md` | Does not exist |
| `docs/USER_MANUAL.md` | Does not exist |
| `docs/CI.md` | Does not exist |

The non-existent docs are not gaps — v001 was a foundation version establishing scaffolding and tooling. These documents become relevant when functional features are added (v002+).
