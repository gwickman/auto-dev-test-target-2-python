# Requirements: 001-pyproject-init

## Goal

Initialize pyproject.toml with uv build backend, project metadata, and dev dependencies.

## Background

This is the first feature of v001, creating the project manifest from which all other features build. The project uses uv as its package manager with the native `uv_build` backend for src-layout projects.

- **Backlog:** BL-001 (Python project scaffolding)
- **Design artifacts:** `comms/outbox/versions/design/v001/`

## Functional Requirements

**FR-001: Project metadata**
- pyproject.toml contains `[project]` section with:
  - `name = "test-target-2"`
  - `version = "0.1.0"`
  - `description = "A minimal Python utility library for auto-dev-mcp integration testing"`
  - `requires-python = ">=3.11"`
- Acceptance: Fields present and correctly formatted

**FR-002: Build system**
- pyproject.toml contains `[build-system]` section with:
  - `requires = ["uv_build>=0.9.21,<0.10.0"]`
  - `build-backend = "uv_build"`
- Acceptance: `uv sync` completes without error

**FR-003: Dev dependencies**
- pyproject.toml contains `[dependency-groups]` section with:
  - `dev = ["pytest", "ruff", "mypy"]`
- Acceptance: `uv sync` installs all dev dependencies

**FR-004: Lock file generation**
- `uv.lock` is auto-generated by `uv sync`
- Acceptance: `uv.lock` exists after `uv sync`

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-001: Configuration standard**
- All tool configuration will be added to pyproject.toml in later features (no separate config files)

## Out of Scope

- Tool configuration sections (ruff, mypy, pytest) — added in Theme 02
- Source code files — added in features 002 and 003
- `.python-version` file — uv manages Python version from requires-python

## Test Requirements

- Verification only: `uv sync` completes successfully
- No automated test file for this feature
