# Implementation Process

## Purpose

Execute the implementation following the starter prompt.

## Inputs

- STARTER_PROMPT.md - Execution instructions
- Development environment ready

## Process

### 1. Run Prerequisites Check

Execute verification commands to confirm starting state.

### 2. Execute Stages Sequentially

For each stage:
1. Review objective and tasks
2. Implement the tasks
3. Run verification commands
4. Fix any issues
5. Commit when passing

### 3. Handle Failures

If verification fails:
1. Review error messages
2. Identify root cause
3. Fix the issue
4. Re-run verification
5. Only proceed when passing

### 4. Track Progress

Update checklist as stages complete.

### 5. Run Final Verification

After all stages:
- Run all tests
- Check linting
- Verify type checking

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Follow project standards
- Keep changes focused

### Commits
- Use specified commit messages
- Commit after each stage
- Don't combine stages

### Documentation
- Update docs as needed
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep README current

## Outputs

- All stages implemented and committed
- All verification passing
- Code review ready

## Next Step

[06-RETROSPECTIVE.md](./06-RETROSPECTIVE.md) - Review the implementation
